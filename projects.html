						<p> The first four pictures relate to the ESN (erasmus social network) free organized trips. Each week, the students could participate in the walking tours, explore the city and cozy places. </p>
						<p>Moreover, this organization provided hiking tours with a guide, who showed the most stunning views of Malaga! I would highly recommend to take part in all activities provided. </p>

						<img class="home-big-pic" src="cadiz.jpg" alt="cadiz">
						<p>The Annual festival Cadiz, the big city on Andalucia´s Atlantic coast, can proudly claim to have the oldest carnival celebrations on mainland Spain.</p><p>The festival takes place each Spring in the southern cities of Spain, but Cadiz is considered to be the capital of carnival. That is why I would highly recommend to visit this city and enjoy the spirit of carnival with all its power and joy!</p>
						<img class="home-big-pic" src="gibraltar.jpg" alt="gibraltar">
						<p>The trip to Gibraltar is the great opportunity to see Africa, meet the Barbary macaques on the Rock, take in St. Michael’s Cave and Europa Point, and upgrade to visit the World War II tunnels, the secret military base built by the British in 1940. This trip is organized by the university UMA, which provides you with all the needed things such as a map, guide, bus, and even breakfast.</p><p>Awareness! Be very attentive, if you have no European Passport, you will not be able to cross the border, as Gibraltar is the part of the UK.</p>
